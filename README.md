# PDE Solver with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a solver for a partial differential equation (PDE) using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The solver utilizes finite difference methods for numerical integration and a neural network to approximate the solution.

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the application of PINNs in solving PDEs. PINNs combine physical knowledge encoded in the form of PDEs with data-driven learning using neural networks to efficiently solve complex physical systems.
