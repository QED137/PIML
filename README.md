The first part of the code is generating data.
The second part is to find the solution of the equation given the boundary condition. The equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + N[u] = 0$ holds for $x \in \Omega$ and $t \in T$.
. Here aim is to infer the possible solution of the equation. $N[u]$ is some function that changes the equation to Sturm - Lioville  in the given boundary condition.
