The first part of the code is generating data.
The second part is to find the solution of the equation given the boundary condition. The equation is   \frac {\partial u}{\partial t} + N[u] = 0, \quad x \in \Omega, \quad t \in T. Here aim is to infer the possible solution of the equation. $N[u]$ is some function that changes equation to Sturm - Lioville  in the given boundary condiiton
